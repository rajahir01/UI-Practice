<h5 class='author-class' id='author-id'>By: Stacy Gray</h5>

CSS:
h5 {
  color: yellow;
}
 
.author-class {
  color: pink;
}
 
#author-id {
  color: cornflowerblue;
}

Each of these rules selects the same element in a different way. Which style will win the “specificity war”?
Because ID is the most specific selector, the element will change to cornflower blue. You may have noticed the other <h5> elements changed to yellow. This is because the most specific (and only) selector they have is their type.
